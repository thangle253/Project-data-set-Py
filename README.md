# Python Application in Car Dataset Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Car Evaluation Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It applies **Python** and **data analysis techniques** to explore, preprocess, and visualize data, as well as to build classification models for predicting car acceptability.

## üìÇ Dataset Information
- **Author:** Marko Bohanec  
- **Creation Date:** May 31, 1997  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation)  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset was originally designed for decision-making model demonstrations in the DEX system, evaluating car acceptability based on price, technical specifications, and safety.

**Features:**
| Feature   | Description                  | Possible Values |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| buying    | Buying price                  | v-high, high, med, low |
| maint     | Maintenance cost              | v-high, high, med, low |
| doors     | Number of doors               | 2, 3, 4, 5-more |
| persons   | Capacity (persons)            | 2, 4, more |
| lug_boot  | Luggage boot size              | small, med, big |
| safety    | Safety level                   | low, med, high |

**Target Variable:**
- Car acceptability: unacc, acc, good, v-good
